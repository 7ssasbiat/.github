## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 We are a team of three girls. Currently studying Data Science at the National Institute Of Statistics and Applied Economics in Morocco.
We are passionate about Statistics, Analytics, Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis, Computer Vision, NLP and Deep Learning and we aim to translate this passion into projects here :smile:

'7ssasbiat', our team name, means in the Moroccan dialect 'Calculator girls', which refer to our passion for applied mathematics. It's also a nickname for all the students of our institut.
